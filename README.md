In this project, the relationship between reported crime density and ridesharing in New York City from 2014 to 2015 was analyzed. Data from multiple sources were complied in the analysis, and including some ".csv" files that were quite large. Furthermore, the original ".ipynb" file used to create the report is large as well and was instead converted to a python script, which can be found in the repository. If you're curious about either the ".csv"s or ".ipynb", copies of them can be found in the following Google Drive folder:
